<PRE>I'm a consultant working with a client on i.MX51 based system (EVK right
now).  TSLIB is working fine with EVK based Touch Screen (resistive), but we
are having some troubles with USB devices.  We also need to move to
Multi-Touch support, and migrate that touch support up to QT (point would be
able to spread fingers like on iPhone, see screen get bigger, etc..).  End
game capacitive devices with zero pressure reading, but multiple coordinates
passed in.

I am currently thinking that I should develop a USB plugin for TSLIB that
handles USB HID devices.  Maybe this is not sound thinking; would like
feedback.

Also, would like any comments on the multi-touch thing; is TSLIB just going
to transparently migrate up multiple coordinates to QT, and QT handles that?

We are more than happy to contribute back to the community in any way we
can; any code development I can pass on, and any notes or tricks on how to
do multi-touch with QT can be added to documentation pages of TSLIB.

I will be happy to share all my work; what I am looking for is to get some
back and forth going on this, see if anyone has solved this problem before,
and if not, use this mailing list as a forum for mutual efforts that can be
pushed into Open Source.

I am a skilled Kernel Engineer who knows his way around, so will avoid
stupid questions (other than above, which may be), and be able to
communicate as such.

Regards,

Thomas Besemer
