</I>
I get events from the touchscreen 

   &lt;penup/down, x, y&gt;

usually a sequence with &quot;pendown&quot; and then one with &quot;penup&quot; when the
user lifts the finger.

I was thinking of algorithms that would call a short touch with little
movement a &quot;click&quot;, while a drag would translate to a real drag.

I was hoping tslib already has this logic implemented. Is that the
case?

&gt;<i> &gt; On the other hand, as far as I can deduce, tslib is meant as a library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a single application, and not meant for use with &quot;X Windows&quot;. So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd need to port my uinput &quot;driver&quot; into tslib so that all tslib
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supported drivers would be able to send events to uinput, which in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; turn allows us to work with X Windows. Right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> tslib was intended to be used by other applications, and is, in many
</I>&gt;<i> cases. The binaries shipped with tslib are for debugging and testing
</I>&gt;<i> only.
</I>
So, I would write a little application that uses tslib to pass events
on to uinput. I would think that it sensible to distribute that with
tslib in the future. 

On the other hand, it seems that the Xserver has tslib input
support. So that part seems taken care of. I'll port my driver to
tslib in the weekend, provided the weather is as bad as is predicted
right now.

The plan was simple, like my brother-in-law Phil. But unlike
Phil, this plan just might work.
