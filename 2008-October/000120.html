<PRE>Hinko,

&gt;<i> No,
</I>&gt;<i> it is up to the application to react upon received event. In most cases you
</I>&gt;<i> only need to know when the button(mouse, keyboard) is being released, as that
</I>&gt;<i> is what is considered the 'real event' -&gt; only when key is 1) pressed and 2)
</I>&gt;<i> released is user seeing another char on the screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was just trying to go and explain what happens..
</I>
I appreciate that, but I was not talking about most cases,  I was
talking about the specific case of ts_calibrate - that would explain
my difficulties.

I've e-mailed Vojtech Pavlik. He says:

&gt;<i> The device doesn't support pressure reporting at all. Tslib incorrectly
</I>&gt;<i> assumes all touchscreens do support pressure.
</I>
I said:
&gt;&gt;<i> Should I modify Tslib's input-raw plugin to take account of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this, and convert release events into press events or something?
</I>
To which he responded:
&gt;<i> You can modify it to report pressure=255 when touch=1 and pressure=0
</I>&gt;<i> when touch=0 for devices that don't report ABS_PRESSURE in the absbit
</I>&gt;<i> array. Then it'll likely work.
</I>
I have a strong feeling that this is exactly what is happening. I'm
going to modify input-raw as described by Vojtech. If you have any
further thoughts, or if you meant to suggest that my proposed hack
wouldn't help the situation for some reason, it'd be great to hear
from you.

As always, thanks,
Peter
