<PRE>Good day everybody,

I successfully integrated tslib on the latest release of xfree86 for a usb
eGalax based touchscreen. Everything works on a embedded system  with the
omap3530 processor.
The system was made up from scratch but is basicly a linux driven system
using the 2.6.22-18 kernel. I did not use eGalax drivers nor the kernel
touchscreen drivers. Everything runs using the usbhid subsystem. My system
uses the /dev/hiddev0 to capture touchscreen data which is then passed to a
custom tslib module that converts the touchscreen raw data into x and y
coordinates.

So far, everything is fine so you are all wandering why am I posting to this
list and why you're losing your time reading me but... Here's my problem. I
think it should be an easy fix but I'm still aking for help, ideas and
comments.

The touchscreen and display is not on the same board as the omap processor
which runs Xfbdev. The device is connected using a vga cable and usb cable.
I want my device to be hotpluggable.
Right now, it works if the device is connected before the framebuffer is
started but as soon as I unplug and replug the display, tslib loses it's
file descriptor and the touchscreen no longer works.
I need to find a way to recover from the disconnection/reconnection of the
device. This file will still be /dev/hiddev0 but the tslib file descriptor
will point to a invalid descriptor. I've seen that in TsWaitForReadable,
there's some code that uses the  FD_ZERO, FD_SET and select functions for
such a recovery but it doesn't work, select always fails. A dirty fix would
be to close the provided fd in the readBytes function and to reopen the file
using an hardcoded /dev/hiddev0 statement. I haven't test this solution but
I'm affraid that Xfbdev might not recover from this as it is responsible for
calling ts_open in the first place.

Soooo, I'm a bit out of ideas. I would like my fix to look like more an
error/trap algo that would be triggered from tslib and catched by Xfbdev (in
tslib.c). Any comments are very appreciated.

thx,
Flip
