When I was trying to quantify resistive touchscreen capabilities I
ended up building a little jig that put a sharpened dowel (like a
pencil point) at a repeatable location on the screen, and wrote
a little app that printed the values as they came off the device
(before tslib ever got to them).

This let me go back to the hardware guys and say &quot;I'm getting a lot of
noise&quot;, which led us to change how our interface worked, and how we
detected button presses and the like (we built a statistical model
that took a number of samples and matched gaussian curves from those
samples and the button position and sizes).

So what I'd do if I were in your shoes is sharpen a dowel, take a board
that you can align to the face of your device, drill a few holes
through that board that you can press the dowel through, and get some
samples so that you can see just what the nature of the data you're
getting from your touchscreen is.

(If it's capacitive rather than resistive, maybe try a Slim Jim or
other dry sausage?)

It may be that your device has enough noise that you're not getting
more resolution than that to begin with.
